## KUBU-HAI



# Introduction
Kubu-Hai Model is a state-of-the-art generative model designed to [brief description of what the model does]. This project aims to provide an easy-to-use framework for training and deploying generative models.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Web4application/kubu-hai.model.h5.git
    cd kubu-hai.model.h5
    pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configuration

Before training the model, configure the parameters in model_config.py:

- learning_rate: The learning rate for the optimizer.

- batch_size: The number of samples per batch.

- epochs: The number of training epochs.

- model_architecture: The architecture of the generative model.

- # Training

 To train the model, run the following command:

    python train_model.py --config model_config.py

Ensure your training data is properly formatted and located in the specified directory.

- ## Evaluation

After training, evaluate the model's performance using:

    python evaluate_model.py --config model_config.py

This will generate metrics and visualizations to help you understand the model's performance.

- ## Generating Outputs

Use the trained model to generate outputs:

    from GenerativeModel import generate, load_model
    # Load the trained model
    model = load_model('path_to_trained_model.h5')
    # Generate output
    output = generate(model, input_data)
    print(output)

- ## Project Structure

-  GenerativeModel/: Contains scripts related to the generative model.

-  Utils/: Includes utility scripts used across the project.

-  model_config.py: Configuration file for the model.

-  requirements.txt: Lists the dependencies required for the project.

-  LICENSE: The MIT License for the project.

- ## USAGE

Here are some examples of how to use the trained model:

    from GenerativeModel import generate, load_model

    # Load the trained model
    model = load_model('path_to_trained_model.h5')

    # Generate output
    output = generate(model, input_data)
    print(output)
